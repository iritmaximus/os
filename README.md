# OS-dev

This will be the start of some OS developed by me :D
Progress will be slow and this will be a project that 
will get periodic bursts, not continuos dev work.

## End-game

The end-goal would be to run GNU-software on the OS, but I doupt it will get to
that point. Another goal would be to get it to run on real hardware.
